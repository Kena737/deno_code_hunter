    "content": "Sometimes it’s the smallest thing that makes a lasting impression. A single smart comment or a couple of small gestures can really impress a woman, while an offensive remark or a display of carelessness can utterly doom your chances. A woman will decide relatively quickly whether or not you’re date-worthy, and all the little things you do or don’t do will help her make up her mind."
